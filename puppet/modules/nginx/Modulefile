summary 'The Nginx module installs and maintains the configuration of the Nginx server.'
description 'The Nginx module allows Puppet to install, configure and maintain the Nginx server. This module is designed such that you have to populate the nginx configuration directory(/etc/nginx/conf.d) with custom file resource definitions. They must be valid nginx configuration files. By default, this directory is empty. This allows you to configure Nginx any way you want'
